Sys-ADL - System Architecture Description Language is a language used to describe system architectures. It contains a set of basic Elements that are put together to create Structures. Later, these Structures can be connected creating Communications between them.
Using Sys-ADL language is possible to describe any system architecture providing several archictecture views.
You will find either Elements, Structures and Communications avaiable in the language and how combine them to describe your architecture.
 

Language Proposal
Sys-ADL language creates a platform that allows describe system architectures in some levels:

Blueprint: Describe only few system elements and enrolled technologies. This document is generally created in initiation or feaseability phase.
Project: Better description of real elements planned to support a solution. This document may be created to describe analysis and design with enough details that allows check project planning and progress.
Business: Describe how a system supports a business;
Design Pattern: Describe patterns that is used to show how a abstract set of elements may be integreated;
Reference: Describes solutions to be adopted to a set of problems.
To reach these objectives, Sys-ADL has some principles:

Basic Elements: A set of visual basic elements that are basic bricks for architecture description construction;
Defined structures and communications: Language forecasts a set of structures and communication that are represented in language. No others can be represented;
Semantic: Language has designed to be interpreted in automated processes;
Attributes: Elements has data attributes that can be registered or showed in diagram.
